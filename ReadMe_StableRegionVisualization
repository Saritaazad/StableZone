Stable Region Extreme Event Propagation Analysis
Overview
Python script for analyzing the spatial propagation of extreme precipitation events from the atmospheric stability zone (3500–4000m) to other elevations in the Northwestern Himalayas. Determines whether extreme events in the stable region co-occur with extreme events elsewhere.
Purpose
Investigates whether the 3500–4000m stability zone acts as a source/trigger region for extreme precipitation events that propagate to lower or higher elevations on the same date.
Key Functions
analyze_stable_region_events()
	•	Loads main meteorological dataset and stable region event catalog
	•	Calculates 95th and 99th percentile precipitation thresholds
	•	For each extreme event date in the stable region, identifies concurrent extremes outside 3500–4000m
	•	Outputs summary statistics and probability of concurrent extremes
plot_events()
	•	Generates Cartopy-based maps for each event date
	•	Visualizes spatial distribution: stable region events (red stars), 99th percentile outside (yellow), 95th percentile outside (orange)
Requirements


pandas
numpy
matplotlib
cartopy
Usage


python
python StableRegionVisualization_V2.py
Inputs:
	•	AllDataAllFeature+Elevation.csv – Full meteorological dataset
	•	extremeEventsSR.csv – Pre-identified extreme events in stable region (must contain Date, Longitude, Latitude, Elevation, Precipitation, Percentile columns)
Output
	•	concurrent_extreme_events_analysis.csv – Summary table with concurrent event counts per date
	•	stable_region_event_*.png – Maps for each event date (when plotting enabled)
Key Metrics
	•	Probability of concurrent extreme events outside stable region
	•	Count of 95th/99th percentile events by elevation zone
	•	Spatial patterns of event propagation
Notes
Uncomment plot_events() call at bottom of script to generate visualization maps.
